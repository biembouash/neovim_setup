99% of the setup comes from thePrimeGen.

Chekcout his nvim setup page https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua

I followed his outdated youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE, a few things had to change, but mostly is the same.

i am using nvim 0.10.1 on unbuntu, installed directly from the github repo https://github.com/neovim/neovim
